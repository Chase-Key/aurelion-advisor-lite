## Section 3: Decision Tree Logic

### Root Question

[Primary decision point]

---

### Branch 1: [Condition A]

**If [Condition A] is true:**

→ **Next Question:** [Sub-decision]  
  - **If [Sub-condition 1]:** → [Outcome/Action]  
  - **If [Sub-condition 2]:** → [Outcome/Action]  

**If [Condition A] is false:**  
→ Proceed to Branch 2

---

### Branch 2: [Condition B]

**If [Condition B] is true:**

→ **Next Question:** [Sub-decision]  
  - **If [Sub-condition 1]:** → [Outcome/Action]  
  - **If [Sub-condition 2]:** → [Outcome/Action]  

**If [Condition B] is false:**  
→ Proceed to Branch 3

---

### Branch 3: [Condition C]

**If [Condition C] is true:**

→ [Outcome/Action]

**If [Condition C] is false:**

→ [Default outcome/Escalation path]

---

## Section 4: Decision Flowchart (Visual)

**Text-Based Decision Flow:**

```
START
  |
  ├─ [Question 1] ?
  │   ├─ YES → [Question 2] ?
  │   │   ├─ YES → [Outcome A]
  │   │   └─ NO → [Outcome B]
  │   └─ NO → [Question 3] ?
  │       ├─ YES → [Outcome C]
  │       └─ NO → [Outcome D]
  |
END
```

**For Complex Visual Maps:**  
Consider using diagramming tools like:
- Miro, Lucidchart, draw.io
- Markdown flowchart extensions
- Spreadsheet decision matrix

## Best Practices

### Creating Effective Decision Trees

✅ **Start simple** - Complex trees are hard to follow  
✅ **Use binary splits when possible** - Yes/No is clearest  
✅ **Prioritize by impact** - Most important factors first  
✅ **Document exceptions** - Note edge cases  
✅ **Test with examples** - Walk through real scenarios  
✅ **Update regularly** - Frameworks drift without maintenance  

### Common Pitfalls to Avoid

❌ Too many branches (analysis paralysis)  
❌ Vague criteria (hard to apply consistently)  
❌ No escalation path (what if nothing fits?)  
❌ No documentation of actual decisions (can't improve)  
❌ Static framework (never updated)  

---

## When to Use This Template

**Use for:**
- Recurring strategic decisions
- Complex multi-factor choices
- Process standardization
- Training new team members on decision logic
- Regulatory or compliance-driven decisions
- Resource allocation decisions

**Don't use for:**
- One-off, unique decisions (overkill)
- Simple binary choices (too much overhead)
- Purely emotional or subjective decisions
- Decisions requiring expert judgment case-by-case

---

## Decision Matrix Alternative

**For decisions with multiple weighted criteria:**

| Option | Criterion 1 (Weight: X) | Criterion 2 (Weight: Y) | Criterion 3 (Weight: Z) | Total Score |
|--------|-------------------------|-------------------------|-------------------------|-------------|
| Option A | Score | Score | Score | Weighted Total |
| Option B | Score | Score | Score | Weighted Total |
| Option C | Score | Score | Score | Weighted Total |

**Use a decision matrix when:**
- Multiple viable options exist
- Criteria can be weighted and scored
- Objective comparison is valuable

**Use a decision tree when:**
- Logic flows through sequential questions
- Each branch eliminates certain paths
- Clear IF/THEN structure exists

---

## Integration with Other Templates

**Combine with:**
- **Project Investigation Template:** Use decision trees for investigation workflows
- **SOP Library:** Document routine decisions as reusable procedures
- **Communication Standards:** Define decision communication protocols
- **Hub Index:** Link to all decision frameworks in one place
