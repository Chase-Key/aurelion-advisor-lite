## How to Use This Template

### **Purpose of a Glossary**
A glossary serves as a living reference for:
- **Onboarding:** New team members quickly learn domain language
- **Clarity:** Reduces misunderstandings from ambiguous terminology
- **Efficiency:** No need to repeatedly explain common terms
- **Knowledge Retention:** Captures institutional knowledge before expertise leaves
- **Cross-functional Communication:** Bridges terminology gaps between teams

### **When to Add a Term**
Add a term when it:
- **Is used frequently** in your daily work
- **Has specific meaning** in your domain (not general English)
- **Is an acronym** that may not be obvious to others
- **Confuses newcomers** or requires repeated explanation
- **Has evolved** from general use to specific meaning in your context
- **Appears in documentation** and needs definition for readers

### **Term Entry Structure**
Each glossary entry should include:

1. **Term/Acronym:** The word or abbreviation being defined
2. **Definition:** Clear, concise explanation (1-3 sentences)
3. **Example:** Real-world usage to provide context
4. **Related Terms:** Cross-references to similar or connected concepts
5. **Synonyms/Aliases:** Other names for the same concept (if applicable)
6. **See Also:** Links to where this term is used in your documentation
