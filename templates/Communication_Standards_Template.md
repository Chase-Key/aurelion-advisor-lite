## Status Report Email Template

Use this structure for regular status reports and deliverable updates.

### **Subject Line**

```
[Deliverable Type] for [Time Period]
```

**Examples:**

- `Project Analysis - Q1 2026 Data Review`
- `Monthly Deliverable for February 2026`

---

### **Email Body Structure**

#### **Header Section**

```
[Deliverable Type] for [TIME PERIOD]

[Optional: Special context note about scope or coverage]
```

**Examples of header notes:**
- "Report includes historical analysis (2020-2025)"
- "Analysis covers [specific scope or limitations]"
- "Deliverable includes [additional context]"

---

#### **Key Changes Summary**

Document what changed from previous period or baseline.

```
**Key Changes**

Increases:
- [Metric/Category]: [Change %/Amount], [Reason/Context]
- [Metric/Category]: [Change %/Amount], [Reason/Context]

Decreases:
- [Metric/Category]: [Change %/Amount], [Reason/Context]

No Changes:
- [Summary of consistent metrics or observations]
```

**Example:**

```
**Key Changes**

Increases:
- Data completeness: +8% (new validation rules implemented)
- Processing volume: +12% (expanded coverage area)

Decreases:
- Error rate: -5% (process improvements applied)

No Changes:

## Documentation Best Practices

### **1. Clarity & Specificity**
- ✅ **DO:** "Processing volume increased 15% this week due to seasonal trend; validated against historical patterns"
- ❌ **DON'T:** "Volume went up"

### **2. Quantify Everything**
- ✅ **DO:** "Identified 8 edge cases out of 12,540 records (0.06%)"
- ❌ **DON'T:** "Found a few issues"

### **3. Verify and Cite Sources**
- ✅ **DO:** "Verified via spot-check of 50 records; 100% match to source data"
- ❌ **DON'T:** "Looks correct"

### **4. Document Patterns**
- ✅ **DO:** "This matches Q1 2025 pattern; consistent seasonal behavior"
- ❌ **DON'T:** "It's normal" (without context)

### **5. Flag Issues Proactively**
- ✅ **DO:** "IN PROGRESS - Awaiting clarification on data field X; expected resolution by Feb 20"
- ❌ **DON'T:** "There's a problem" (too vague)

### **6. Maintain Consistency**
- ✅ **DO:** Use same structure each period; makes trends visible
- ❌ **DON'T:** Change format arbitrarily

### **7. Provide Context**
- ✅ **DO:** "Error rate 0.8% (target: <1%, historical average: 1.2%)"
- ❌ **DON'T:** "Error rate 0.8%" (without benchmarks)

### **8. Use Professional Tone**
- ✅ **DO:** "Analysis complete; deliverable ready for review"
- ❌ **DON'T:** "Done!" or overly casual language
