## Operational Decision Trees

### Issue Triage Decision Tree

```
Issue detected
├─ Severity?
│  ├─ Critical (blocking production/users)
│  │  └─ Immediate escalation + team notification
│  ├─ High (impacting quality/deadlines)
│  │  └─ Document + inform manager + plan fix
│  └─ Low (minor issue, no immediate impact)
│     └─ Add to backlog for resolution
├─ Can I fix it?
   ├─ Yes, in <15 min → Fix now, document later
   ├─ Yes, but takes >15 min → Schedule fix, notify stakeholders
   └─ No (outside my expertise)
      └─ Escalate to [appropriate team/person]
```

### Time Management Decision Tree

```
New task arrives
├─ Is it urgent AND important?
│  ├─ Yes → Do now (or delegate if possible)
│  └─ No → Evaluate further
│     ├─ Important but not urgent
│     │  └─ Schedule for focus time
│     ├─ Urgent but not important
│     │  └─ Delegate or batch with similar tasks
│     └─ Neither urgent nor important
│        └─ Defer or decline
```

### Escalation Decision Tree

```
Need help with issue
├─ Who owns this area?
│  ├─ Me → Can I solve with available resources?
│  │  ├─ Yes → Document solution as I work
│  │  └─ No → Escalate to manager/team lead
│  └─ Another team
│     └─ Contact [appropriate team] via [channel]
├─ What's the timeline?
│  ├─ Blocking critical work → Escalate immediately
│  ├─ Needed today → Email + Slack + follow-up call
│  ├─ Needed this week → Email with clear deadline
