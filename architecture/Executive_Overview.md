## 🚀 How to Use Your Knowledge Engine

### **Daily Use (5-15 minutes)**

**When you need information:**
1. Open 00_Hub_Index.md
2. Find your question in "Quick Navigation" table
3. Click the link to the relevant file
4. Use Ctrl+F to search within the file if needed
5. Follow cross-references to related content

**Examples:**
- "What are my current priorities?" → Workload_Reference.md
- "How do I format documentation?" → Communication_Standards.md → Cross-reference to QA_Standards.md
- "What's the escalation procedure?" → SOP_Library.md → Decision tree
- "What does [TERM] mean?" → Glossary.md

---

### **Weekly Use (30-60 minutes)**

**Update relevant files with new information:**

Weekly review:
- Update Daily_Operations_Playbook.md if processes changed
- Update Workload_Reference.md with new assignments
- Update SOP_Library.md if procedures changed
- Update Query_Reference_Library.md if you created new queries

Keep hub current so it stays valuable.

---

### **Monthly Use (1-2 hours)**

**Review and expand:**
- Review hub statistics (how often are files referenced?)
- Identify gaps (What questions keep coming up that aren't answered?)
- Add new case studies or methodology insights
- Consider small improvements (better cross-links, clearer explanations)

---

### **Quarterly Use (2-4 hours)**

**Strategic updates:**
- Update Career_Master.md with quarterly progress
- Update Skills_Inventory.md with new certifications or proficiency changes
- Update Leadership_Development.md with mentorship activities
- Update Project_Investigation_Template.md with new insights from completed investigations

---

### **The Power of Cross-References**

**You never have to search for related content.** Every file has a "Cross-References" section.

**Example workflow:**

1. Question: "How do I investigate an anomaly?"
2. Start: Project_Investigation_Template.md
3. Cross-reference: → Case_Study_1.md (see concrete example)
4. Cross-reference: → Case_Study_2.md (see current project)
5. Cross-reference: → Query_Reference_Library.md (find query templates)
6. Cross-reference: → QA_Standards.md (understand quality expectations)
7. Cross-reference: → SOP_Library.md (find escalation procedure if needed)

**Total time:** 10-15 minutes to fully understand the approach. Without hub: 60+ minutes searching, asking people, piecing it together.

---

### **Three Navigation Patterns**

#### **Pattern 1: Quick Lookup (2-5 minutes)**
"I need to know X right now"
- Hub_Index → Quick Navigation table → Click → Find answer

#### **Pattern 2: Understanding a Concept (10-20 minutes)**
"I need to understand how we approach Y"
- Hub_Index → Click main file → Read → Follow cross-references to related content → Comprehensive understanding

#### **Pattern 3: Deep Research (1-2 hours)**
"I'm starting a major project. I need to understand everything related to Z"
- Hub_Index → Main file → Cross-references → Case studies → Templates → Query reference → Best practices
- Result: Full framework and historical context for project
