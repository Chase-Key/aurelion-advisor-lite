## 💡 Skills Reflection

### My Learning Style

**What works for me:**
- 📹 **Video courses** with hands-on exercises (Udemy, DataCamp work well)
- 🛠️ **Learn by doing** real work projects (not just tutorials)
- 📝 **Documentation** of what I learn (this hub reinforces learning)
- 👥 **Pair learning** with more experienced people (DevOps engineer for Python)

**What doesn't work:**
- ❌ Reading dense technical books (lose focus)
- ❌ Learning without application (forget quickly)
- ❌ Long courses with no milestones (lose motivation)

### Skills Meta-Learning

**Patterns I've noticed:**
1. **I learn fastest when there's a real problem to solve**
    - SQL skills accelerated when I had actual business questions
    - Tableau improved rapidly when building real dashboards

2. **Documentation = retention**
   - If I don't write it down, I forget it
   - This hub and SQL library are learning tools disguised as reference docs

3. **Teaching forces mastery**
   - Explaining SQL to new hires revealed my own knowledge gaps
   - Mentorship makes me better at my own work

4. **Breadth before depth (early career), depth before breadth (now)**
   - Early: Learned many tools to find what I liked
   - Now: Going deep on SQL, Tableau, Python (core stack)
