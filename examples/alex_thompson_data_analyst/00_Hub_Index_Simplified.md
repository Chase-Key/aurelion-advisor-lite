## 🔄 My Hub Workflow

### Daily Routine (15 minutes/day)
**Morning (8:00 AM):**
1. Open [03_Daily_Operations_Snippet.md](03_Daily_Operations_Snippet.md)
2. Review today's priorities (top 3 tasks)
3. Check blockers from yesterday—any resolved?
4. Time-block calendar based on priorities

**End of Day (4:45 PM):**
1. Update Daily Operations—what got done?
2. Note any wins (completed projects, good feedback, solved problems)
3. Prep tomorrow's top 3 tasks
4. Flag anything for Communication Log (key decisions, async updates to team)

---

### Weekly Review (Fridays, 30 minutes)
**What I Review:**
1. **Wins:** What went well this week? (add to Wins Tracker)
2. **Skills:** Any new learning? (update Skills Inventory if meaningful progress)
3. **Relationships:** Anyone I need to follow up with? (check Network Map)
4. **Projects:** Are timelines on track? Any risks? (update Project files)
5. **Priorities:** Next week's top 3 goals

**Questions I Ask:**
- Am I working on the right things? (aligned with Career Master goals)
- Am I making progress on Python development? (Q1 2026 skill focus)
- Am I visible enough to stakeholders? (building relationships for promotion)

---

### Monthly Review (1st Friday of month, 60 minutes)
**Deep Dive:**
1. **Career Master check:** On track for 1-year goals?
   - Python proficiency target (July 2026) - currently 40% through course ✅
   - Lead strategic project - Churn Analysis qualifies ✅
   - Present to VP level - Delivered Feb 25 ✅

2. **Skills Inventory update:** Reassess proficiency levels
   - Any skills move from Developing → Proficient?
   - Any new skills to add?
   - Adjust Q1 development plan if needed

3. **Wins Tracker consolidation:** Quantify achievements
   - Example: Churn Analysis = potential $400K revenue saved
   - Add to promotion case evidence

4. **Network Map refresh:** Relationship health check
   - Anyone I haven't connected with in 30+ days?
   - Any new stakeholders add to map?

---

### Quarterly Strategic Review (90 minutes)
**Big Picture Assessment:**
- Review 5-year vision, 3-year milestones (Career Master)

, projects, stakeholders, mentorship)

- Solicit feedback from manager and peers
- Adjust skill development plan (if career direction shifts)

**Questions I Ask:**

## 🎓 How I Built This Hub

**Timeline:**
- **Q3 2023:** Started with just Daily Operations checklist (simple to-do list)
- **Q4 2023:** Added Career Master after missing out on promotion (needed clarity on goals)
- **Q1 2024:** Skills Inventory added when manager asked "what do you want to learn?"
- **Mid 2024:** Project Investigation template after Churn Analysis (realized I needed reusable methodology)
- **Late 2025:** Network Map, Communication Log (preparing for Senior Analyst role—need stakeholder management)
- **Current:** Integrated system, ~12 active documents, daily habit

**Philosophy:**
- **Start small:** Don't try to build entire system at once
- **Solve problems:** Add files when you have a need (not preemptively)
- **Iterate:** Hub evolved over time based on what I actually used
- **Consistency > Perfection:** Better to update Daily Operations every day (even quick notes) than skip because "I don't have time to do it perfectly"

## 📖 Lessons Learned

### What Works
✅ **Daily Operations is my anchor** - If I only updated one file, this is it. Keeps me focused.  
✅ **Career Master clarity** - Having 5-year vision written down = massive confidence boost. I know where I'm going.  
✅ **Skills Inventory for development discussions** - Manager loves that I come to 1:1s with specific learning plan.  
✅ **Project Investigation template** - Churn Analysis would have taken 2x longer without structured methodology.  
✅ **Weekly reviews are non-negotiable** - This habit alone = 50% of hub value. Keeps everything current.

### What I Adjusted
🔄 **Stopped using:** Glossary (didn't need it—terminology was easy to remember)  
🔄 **Combined files:** Merged "Meeting Notes" into Communication Log (less redundant)  
🔄 **Simplified templates:** Original templates were too detailed—I streamlined to what I actually fill out  
🔄 **Archive old projects:** Moved 2023 projects to separate file so My Hub isn't cluttered

### Mistakes to Avoid
❌ **Don't over-engineer:** I initially had 25 files—too many, couldn't maintain  
❌ **Don't wait for perfection:** Just start typing—structure emerges with use  
❌ **Don't skip reviews:** Went 6 weeks without weekly review once—hub became outdated, lost value  
❌ **Don't copy someone else's system:** This hub is MINE (works for my role, career). Yours should be different.

## 🚀 How You Can Adapt This

**If you're a Data Analyst (like me):**
- Start with: Career Master + Skills Inventory + Daily Operations
- Add project investigation template if you do deep analyses
- Add Reference Library for SQL/Python snippets (HUGE time saver)

**If you're in a different role:**
- **Project Manager:** Focus on Network Map, Communication Log, Decision Tree
- **Software Engineer:** Skills Inventory (technical depth), Reference Library (code snippets), Project Archive (portfolio)
- **Manager:** Network Map, Communication Log, 1:1 notes, team development plan
- **Early career:** Career Master (clarity), Skills Inventory (development plan), Daily Operations (build habits)

**If you're at different career stage:**
- **Junior (0-2 years):** Focus on skills development + daily productivity
- **Mid-level (3-5 years, me!):** Add project portfolio + stakeholder management
- **Senior (5+ years):** Strategic decision-making + mentorship + leadership documentation

## 📞 How I Use AI with My Hub

**AI is my thinking partner** (not my automation tool)

**How I prompt:**
```
"Here's my Career Master 5-year vision. I just completed the Customer Churn Analysis 
project. Help me update my Advancement Evidence section—what should I highlight for my 
promotion case?"
```

```
"I'm updating my Skills Inventory. I'm currently 'Developing' in Python (40% through 
course). What should I focus on next to reach 'Proficient' level? Suggest 3 learning 
resources."
```

```
"Review my Daily Operations from last week. I'm seeing a pattern of too many context 
switches. Suggest time-blocking strategy that protects deep work time for analysis."
```

**What AI helps with:**
- Brainstorming career moves (strategy)
- Structuring complex projects (methodology)
- Writing professional emails (communication)
- Analyzing my own patterns (self-awareness)

**What I DON'T use AI for:**
- Automatic updates (I write my own content—it's MY hub)
- Decision-making (AI suggests, I decide)
- Replacing manager conversations (AI is a thinking tool, not a substitute for human feedback)
