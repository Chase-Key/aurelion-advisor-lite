## 🚧 Blockers & Challenges

### Current Challenges

**Challenge 1: Python Learning Curve**
- **Issue:** Harder than expected to translate SQL thinking to Python
- **Impact:** Taking longer than planned (3 months → 6 months)
- **Plan:** Pair with DevOps team member who offered to help

**Challenge 2: Stakeholder Presentation Anxiety**
- **Issue:** Confident with Directors, nervous presenting to VPs
- **Impact:** May limit visibility needed for promotion
- **Plan:** Practice with manager, start with smaller VP meetings first

**Challenge 3: Balancing Mentorship with Deliverables**
- **Issue:** Helping Sarah takes time, feeling stretched
- **Impact:** Some weeks struggle to meet both commitments
- **Plan:** Be more intentional about scheduled mentorship time (vs. ad-hoc)

## 💡 Lessons Learned

### What's Working

**Building this Knowledge Hub**
- Huge confidence booster (can see my own growth)
- Makes performance reviews easier (evidence documented)
- Team has noticed and adopted some practices
- Manager references it positively

**Taking Initiative**
- Automation project, SQL library, onboarding docs all came from me volunteering
- Led to promotion and increased visibility
- Pattern: See problem → Document solution → Share with team → Recognition

**Asking for Feedback**
- Regular check-ins with manager about growth areas
- Asking peers "What should I know that I don't?"
- Creates opportunities to improve before problems arise

### What I'd Do Differently

**Earlier Python Investment**
- Waited too long to start (everyone said "learn Python," didn't prioritize it)
- Now playing catch-up when it should've been gradual
- Lesson: Address skill gaps early before they become blockers

**More Strategic Thinking Earlier**
- First 2 years focused on technical correctness
- Took time to learn to frame analysis in business terms
- Lesson: Always start with "Why does this matter?" before "How do I query this?"

**Document Success Stories Better**
- Good at documenting process, less good at documenting impact
- Some projects I can't fully quantify their value (didn't track metrics upfront)
- Lesson: Define success metrics at project start

## 📝 Notes & Reflections

### Monthly Reflection (February 2026)

**What went well this month:**
- Customer Churn project is on track
- Python course progress feels sustainable
- Sarah is responding well to mentorship (she thanked me in team meeting!)

**What I struggled with:**
- Feeling stretched between deliverables and learning time

**What I learned:**
- I don't need to be perfect at Python before applying it to work
- Small scripts that automate annoying tasks are great learning projects
- Mentorship is rewarding but also time-consuming (need  better boundary)

**Adjustment for next month:**
- Block 2 hours on Friday mornings for Python learning (calendar protected time)
