## 🎯 What Is ADVISOR?

**Your Strategic Direction Guide and Career GPS**

ADVISOR is a personal knowledge management and strategic planning system built on the **AAI 5-floor library architecture** (inspired by Rell's Darklight Chambers from Stonecrest).

Think of it as your **personal methodology library** that helps you:
- 📊 Track career advancement and skills development
- 📝 Document investigation methodologies and workflows  
- 🗺️ Map stakeholder relationships and organizational dynamics
- 🎯 Set and track long-term strategic goals
- 📚 Organize professional knowledge using a 5-floor framework

---

## 🏛️ The 5-Floor Architecture

ADVISOR organizes your knowledge like a circular library with 5 floors:

### **Floor 1: Foundation & Navigation (Lore & History)**
*Your operational foundation*

**What lives here:**
- Career planning & advancement roadmap
- Skills inventory & competencies
- Daily operations & responsibilities
- Past project case studies

**Example files:**
- `career-master.md` - Track goals, promotion criteria, evidence
- `skills-inventory.md` - Technical skills, certifications, proficiency levels
- `daily-operations.md` - Recurring tasks, monitoring routines
- `project-archive/` - Past investigations and learnings

---

### **Floor 2: Systems & Understanding (Magic & Aetherstone)**
*Your frameworks and mental models*

**What lives here:**
- Investigation methodologies
- Communication templates & standards
- Quality criteria & checklists
- Learning frameworks

**Example files:**

---

### **Floor 3: Networks & Relationships (People & Politics)**

---

### **Floor 4: Action & Implementation (War & Strategy)**
*Your tactical playbooks and execution guides*

**What lives here:**
- Domain-specific workflows (state research, data investigation, etc.)
- Decision trees for complex problems
- Training curricula & knowledge transfer guides
- Workload analysis frameworks

**Example files:**
- `investigation-decision-tree.md` - When to escalate, what to investigate

---

### **Floor 5: Vision & Meaning (Prophecy & Philosophy)**
*Your long-term thinking and strategic direction*

---

### Building Your Library (First Week)

**Day 1-2:** Foundation (Hub, Career, Skills, Operations) - START HERE  
**Day 3-4:** Add one project using Project Investigation Template  
**Day 5-6:** Add Network Map if you're working on visibility/promotion  
**Day 7:** Weekly review - what worked? What do you actually need?

A: Absolutely! Templates are starting points. Adapt to your domain.
